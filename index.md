# Mission

The mission of our organization is to socially, academically, and professionally 
support underrepresented graduate students within STEM fields at UW-Madison. 
Underrepresentation applies to a variety of backgrounds and identities, including but 
not limited to those of  race/ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, 
income, and ability. We aim to provide a place where students from underrepresented 
backgrounds can feel a sense of belonging despite the lack of diversity often 
encountered in their respective fields. We will improve upon other spaces in the 
university as places of inclusion for students of underrepresented backgrounds. While 
each of us face challenges unique to our experiences and identities, we believe there 
is power in addressing issues of inclusivity and representation together. Where we 
have privilege, we can use it to lift each other up; where we face barriers, we can 
lean on our community for strength.
